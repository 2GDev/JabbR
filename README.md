A few more things:

* Sort your usings
* Spaces not tabs (I won't even look at the PR if you use tabs)
* Follow the **existing** conventions you see in the project (that means, brace style, formatting etc).
* If you aren't sure about something, ask in the [meta](http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/meta) room on jabbr.
